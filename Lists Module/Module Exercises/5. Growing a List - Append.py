# We can add a single element to a list using the .append() Python method.

# Suppose we have an empty list called garden:

# garden = []
# We can add the element "Tomatoes" by using the .append() method:

# garden.append("Tomatoes")
 
# print(garden)
# Will output:

# ['Tomatoes']
# We see that garden now contains "Tomatoes"!

# When we use .append() on a list that already has elements, our new element is added to the end of the list:

# # Create a list
# garden = ["Tomatoes", "Grapes", "Cauliflower"]
 
# # Append a new element
# garden.append("Green Beans")
# print(garden)
# Will output:

# ['Tomatoes', 'Grapes', 'Cauliflower', 'Green Beans']
# Letâ€™s use the .append() method to manipulate a list.

orders = ["daisies", "periwinkle"]

# Jiho works for a gardening store called Petal Power. Jiho keeps a record of orders in a list called orders.

# Use print to inspect the orders he has received today.

print(orders)

# Jiho just received a new order for "tulips". Use append to add this string to orders.

orders.append("tulips")

# Another order has come in! Use append to add "roses" to orders.

orders.append("roses")

# Use print to inspect the orders Jiho has received today.

print(orders)
