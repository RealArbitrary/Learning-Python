# When we want to add multiple items to a list, we can use + to combine two lists (this is also known as concatenation).

# Below, we have a list of items sold at a bakery called items_sold:

# items_sold = ["cake", "cookie", "bread"]
# Suppose the bakery wants to start selling "biscuit" and "tart":

# items_sold_new = items_sold + ["biscuit", "tart"]
# print(items_sold_new)
# Would output:

# ['cake', 'cookie', 'bread', 'biscuit', 'tart']
# In this example, we created a new variable, items_sold_new, which contained both the original items sold, and the new items. We can inspect the original items_sold and see that it did not change:

# print(items_sold)
# Would output:

# ['cake', 'cookie', 'bread']
# We can only use + with other lists. If we type in this code:

# my_list = [1, 2, 3]
# my_list + 4
# we will get the following error:

# TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
# If we want to add a single element using +, we have to put it into a list with brackets ([]):

# my_list + [4]
# Letâ€™s use + to practice combining two lists!
